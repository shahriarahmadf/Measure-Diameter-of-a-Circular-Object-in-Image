# Measure-Diameter-of-a-Circular-Object-in-Image
This is a MATLAB program to detect and measure the diameter of a circular object in image.

A picture of a steel mug was analysed and the circular mug surface was detected by the program. However, there is some limitation to the detection when the surface
when the surface is not a completely smooth one. The diameter measured is in pixel dimension.
